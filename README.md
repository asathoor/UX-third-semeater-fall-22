# Adobe Animate Tutorials

## Interactive Data Based Infographics

Interactive productions react to the actions of a user. Adobe Animate is a great tool for interactive animations. In the B2B case we will create infographics that respond to events, such as clicks, mouseovers and similar.

In this class you'll work with interactive infographics with data visualizations for a B2B case. You will learn the basic animation principles such as:

* Productions for the web via HTML `<canvas>` and JavaScript.
* Animation principles, like frame-by-frame and tweens.
* How to connect parts of characters by hard or soft "bones".
* Interactive buttons and how to trigger them via JavaScript events.
* How to use JavaScript objects, such as variables or JSON in the production.
